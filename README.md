# Social-Pop-Widget
Keep your website + user's privacy: use this as a locally hosted social sharing widget.

	----- TO USE ----- 
	1. Simply include the following where you want it to show:
	<script src="js/socialpop.js?tw|fb|gp|li"></script>
	
	----- CUSTOMIZE -----
	1. You can choose which icons to show; use their abbreviations (tw|fb|gp|li), seperated w/ the 'pipe' symbol ( | )
	2. You can set window dimensions below; height (h) and width (w), defaulted to 626x436
	3. Feel free to delete any comments for performance benefits (minimal file-size savings)

	----- CREDIT -----
	-This widget is built upon Compartir v0.04. Kudos to the team on the excellent work. 
	-I've never used AddThis, as I've always suspected privacy & security issues. 
	-This is also the main reason why I'm extending your work!
	
	----- UPCOMING -----
	in v0.2 -- I'll add base64 encoded icons to reduce http requests, 
	as well as more social sharing sources.
