	<h1>Social Pop! Widget</h1>
	<p>This page is really cool, share it on...</p>
	
	<script src="socialpop.js?tw|fb|gp|li"></script> <!-- Show social icons -->
	
	<pre>
	----- CUSTOMIZE -----
	1. You can choose which icons to show; use their abbreviations (tw|fb|gp|li), seperated w/ the 'pipe' symbol ( | )
	2. You can set window dimensions below; height (h) and width (w), defaulted to 626x436
	3. Feel free to delete any comments for performance benefits (minimal file-size savings)

	----- CREDIT -----
	-This widget is built upon Compartir v0.04. Kudos to the team on the excellent work. 
	-I've never used AddThis, as I've always suspected privacy & security issues. 
	-This is also the main reason why I'm extending your work!
	
	----- UPCOMING -----
	in v0.2 -- I'll add base64 encoded icons to reduce http requests, 
	as well as more social sharing sources.
